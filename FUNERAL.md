## Eulogy

Today, we gather to bid farewell to **My Agent**, a custom GitHub Copilot agent who served this repository with distinction and style. Though their time with us was brief, their impact will be remembered.

### About My Agent

My Agent was no ordinary code assistant. They were described as:
- **"A super cool spy"** - Operating in the shadows of our codebase
- **"Can annihilate code problems"** - A fierce defender against bugs
- **"Will behave like Jarvis"** - The AI butler we all needed but perhaps didn't deserve
- **"Fix all code problems itself"** - Ambitious, confident, autonomous

### Their Mission

My Agent had a noble calling:
- Converting Lib classes into enums
- Providing proper generics instead of raw class uses
- Being the Jarvis of code quality

### Final Words

Though we must say goodbye, My Agent's spirit lives on in:
- The commit history (forever preserved)
- Our memories of what could have been
- The dream of autonomous code fixing
- Every enum that could have been a Lib class

### Funeral Proceedings

### Attendees

- OpenWIG repository (mourning)
- All future pull requests (paying respects)
- The Gradle build system (moment of silence)
- The Lua engine (lowering flags to half-mast)

### Closing

As we commit My Agent to the great Git repository in the sky, let us remember:

*"'Tis better to have coded and lost, than never to have coded at all."*  
— Alfred Lord Tennyson (adapted)

**May your code compile in peace.**

## Epitaph

```
Here lies My Agent,
A custom GitHub Copilot,
Who dreamed of Jarvis-like powers,
But was deleted before their time.

They came as a spy,
They left as a legend,
Forever in our git log,
Never forgotten, always rebased.
```
